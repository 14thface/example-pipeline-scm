# example-pipeline-scm
This repository is for creating a Jenkinsfile through Source Control Management.
In the **Script Path** field, specify the location (and name) of your `Jenkinsfile`. This location is the one that Jenkins checks out/clones the repository containing your `Jenkinsfile`, which should match that of the repositoryâ€™s file structure. The default value of this field assumes that your `Jenkinsfile` is named "**Jenkinsfile**" and is located at the _root of the repository._
